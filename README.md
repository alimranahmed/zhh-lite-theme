## KISS(keep it simple)

#### Why another theme?
Most good(*clean, minimalistic) themes has its prompt in the same line as the directory. 
The problems are when the path grows, the command sometime **doesn't fit in the same line** anymore.
This theme **solves that problem**. The current working directory in one line and the command prompt is in new lien below. 
Along with that, **it's clean and minimalistic**.
